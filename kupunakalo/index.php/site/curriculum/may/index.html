<div class="leftcol">
<p>1. Kalo can be harvested if it was planted this past August or September.</p>
<p>2. Have a great lū&lsquo;au, party with your kupuna. Give thanks.</p>
<p>Can any students bring a papa ku&lsquo;i &lsquo;ai (pounding board) and pōhaku (stones) to pound pa&lsquo;i&lsquo;ai (pounded taro, not yet diluted with water)?</p>
<p>3. Return to that list of students&rsquo; reactions to eating kalo done back in September. Do the haumana (students) have a greater appreciation of Hāloa now?</p>
<p>Kupuna Mary Kawena Pukui said 'that when the poi bowl was open there must be no quarreling, haggling, or arguing, for this would offend Hāloa who was present in the form of the poi. Eating around the poi bowl was a time for pleasant sociability, not argument.' From <em>Native Planters In Old Hawaii, Their Life, Lore, and Environment.</em>, Page 81.</p>
<p>4. This section of the website is about the students and their future plans.</p>
<p>View farming as a career through this series of interviews in the video, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv7ljiQIq6Q&amp;NR=1" target="_blank"><em>Lessons From Experience</em></a>, min. 5:27. By cornellsmallfarms. Link to Youtube.com. This video is part of a series by Cornell University Cooperative Extension Services.</p>
<p>5. Brainstorm on a whiteboard the students&rsquo; dream jobs. Ask them to get more specific about the qualities that make these careers interesting and exciting.</p>
<p>6. The development of this website grew from talking story with people in interesting careers. This section aims to introduce students to jobs and opportunities they may not have looked at before. Information includes estimated starting incomes.</p>
<p>A farmer is not paid a salary. He or she is an independent businessperson and his or her own boss. The farmer's income depends on producing a crop. A farmer may have thousands of dollars invested in land and machinery. Costs include property taxes, equipment maintenance, fuel costs, planting material, fertilizer, their personal health insurance, liability insurance, crop insurance, etc. He or she observes weather and the environment. From Payscale.com: $20,849 to $43,051.</p>
<p>A U.S. Peace Corps volunteer is invited by a foreign nation to facilitate development projects within a community, as a representative of the U.S. government. 2-3 year contract. Salary of a volunteer on Pohnpei, FSM (Micronesia) in year 1998: $4,380.</p>
<p>A botanist at a botanical garden studies plants and ecosystems. He or she protects culturally important varieties and educates the community. From Payscale.com: $32,124 - $66,623.</p>

In year 2008, the governor and state legislators approved Act 211 to fund a <a href="http://www.oha.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1049&amp;Itemid=152" target="_blank">Taro Security and Purity Task Force</a>. The task force&rsquo;s 18 members included kalo farmers, educators and legislators.</p>

<p>9. Discuss how we get land for farming. Here in Hawai&rsquo;i, the availability of farming land is influenced by the rulings of the <a href="http://luc.state.hi.us/about.htm" target="_blank">Land Use Commission</a> (LUC). Link to LUC website. The Commission is composed of nine members, who are appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the State Senate. The Commission's role is to ensure that the state&rsquo;s concerns are addressed when land use decisions are made. This includes zoning for agricultural lands.</p>

Our access to fresh water is influenced by the <a href="http://hawaii.gov/dlnr/cwrm/aboutus_commission.htm" target="_blank">Water Resource Management Commission</a> (WRMC). Link to WRMC website. The Commission consists of seven members, five of whom are appointed by the governor and confirmed by the State Senate. The remaining two are the Chairperson of the State Board of Land and Natural Resources, and the Director of the State Department of Health. The members are unpaid and serve a limited term.</p>
